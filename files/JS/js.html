        <h3>What is Scripting?</h3>
        <p>A script is program code that doesn‚Äôt need pre-processing (e.g. compiling) before being run. In the context of a Web browser, scripting usually refers to program code written in JavaScript that is executed by the browser when a page is loaded, or in response to an event triggered by the user.</p>   
        
        <h3>Types of script:</h3><p>Scripts are classified into the following two types.</p>
        <ol><li>Client-side script</li>
        <li>Server-side script</li></ol>

        <h3>Client-side script:</h3>
        <ul><li>These scripts are getting executed within the web Browser (client).</li>
            <li>Here we don‚Äôt need any software.</li>
            <li>These scripts are used for client-side validations (data verification & data validations)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ex: JavaScript, VBScript, typescript etc‚Ä¶</p>

        <h3>Server-side script: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A script which executes in server machine with support of the web-server/app-server software‚Äôs like IIS(Internet information services), Tomcat,  JBOSS, etc. </li>
            <li>These scripts are used for server-side validations (authentication & authorization).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ex: php, jsp, asp.net, VueScript, Express Script, nodeJS, cgi, perl etc‚Ä¶</p>
        <h1>Script VS Language</h1><br>

                <tr><td>Easy to understand compare to PL</td><td>Complex to understand compare to Script</td></tr>
                <tr><td>External libraries not required</td><td>Required</td></tr>
                <tr><td>No special compiler required</td><td>Special compiler mandatory</td></tr>

                <tr><td>Ex: JavaScript, VBScript,TypeScript, Perl, Shell etc.</td><td>Ex: C, CPP, vb.net, Java etc.</td></tr>

        <ul>
            <li>In 1995, JavaScript was created by a Netscape(Mozilla)  developer named ‚ÄúBrendan Eich‚Äù.</li>

    <div id="why js">
        <fieldset><legend>Why is it called JavaScript?</legend>
            <p>When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: ‚ÄúLiveScript‚Äù. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a ‚Äúyounger brother‚Äù of Java would help.</p>
            <p>But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.</p>
            <h3>JS ü°∫ ES</h3>
            <p>Later JavaScript became an ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association Script) standard in 1997. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.</p>

            <ul><li>JavaScript is implementation of ES; ES is the specification of JavaScript.</li></ul>

                <li>JavaScript is a case sensitive programme mixed case</li>
                <li>To work with JavaScript, we don‚Äôt need to install any software.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is <b><u>"interpreter-based"</u></b> programming, means the code will be converted into machine language line-by-line. JavaScript interpreter is already <b>embedded in Browsers</b>.</li>

        <fieldset><legend>Why we Use JavaScript?</legend>
            <p>Using HTML/CSS, we can only design a web page but it‚Äôs not supported to perform logical operations <b>such as calculations, decision making and repetitive tasks, dynamically displaying output, reading inputs from the user, and updating content on webpage at client side</b>. Hence to perform these entire tasks at client side we need to use JavaScript.</p>
