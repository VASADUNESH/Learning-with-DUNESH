    <h1><u>HISTORY OF C</u></h1>
    <p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasically “C language” designed in <mark>1972</mark> by <mark>“DENNIS 
    RITCHIE”</mark>
, One of the software engineer in AT & T [ 
American Telephone & Telegraph ] Bell labs
located at Murray hills, new jersy, USA. <br><br>
Ritchie adopted [ taken ] C language from “B 
language” developed by “KEN THOMSON”, One of 
software engineer in <mark> AT & T Bell labs</mark>.<br><br>
B language adopted from BCPL [ basic combined 
programming language ], designed by “MARTIEN 
RICHARDS”, an Assistant professor in “Cambridge 
University”.<br><br>
In 1989 “ANSI” [ American National Standards 
Institute ] released a new version of c language with 
the name “ANSI-C”, which is familiar with the name 
“C-89”.<br><br>
In 1999 IOS [ international organization for 
standardization ], now it is familiar with the name 
ISO [ International Standard Organization ] released 
a new version of C language with the name “C-99”.
Basically the c language developed for rewriting 
UNIX Operating system.<br><br>
Nowadays we can create and execute a c program 
on any machine with any processor. i.e. we can 
create and execute the c program on 80386 / 80486 
/ 80586 / inter core i3 / i5 / i7 / i9 / AMD RAYZON
etc processors. Hence c is also called it is a machine 
independent programming language.<br><br>
For example the programming languages like 8086 / 
8088 are working only in 8086 / 8088 processors. 
Hence they are called machine dependent 
programming languages.<br><br>
But C is a platform dependent language. due to 
machine independent and platform dependent, C is 
a called it is a partial portable language
