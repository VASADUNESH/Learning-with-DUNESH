        <legend>Why C is a high level / middle level language?</legend>
        <details>
            <summary>What is a program?</summary>
            <li class="ans">Set of instructions is called program.</li>
        </details><br>

        <details> 
            <summary>What is a software?</summary>
            <li class="ans">Set of programs is called software. As per the it industry software is a digitalized and automated process.</li>
        </details><br>

        <details>
            <summary>We are having 2 type of software.</summary>
            <li class="ans">1.System software<br>Eg: os, device drivers, translators<br><br>2.Application software<br>Eg: fb, googlepay, phonepe, whatsapp,…</li>

    <fieldset>
        <legend>What is a language?</legend>
        <p>Generally the languages like telugu / English / hindi / Marathi are used to communicate with humans. Hence they are called human languages. To communicate with the machines we have to create the programs [ software ] and for this we are using the computer programming languages like C / C++ / Java / .Net / Python etc.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Computer languages divided into 3 types</summary>
                <li class="ans">1.Machine language:  Created with binary code [0,1].<br>Eg: 10001111</li><br>
                <li class="ans">2.Low level / assembly language: Created with English like shortcuts called MNEMONICS. <br>Eg: gd mrg, add, sub,…</li><br>
                <li class="ans">3.High level language: Created with simple English and easy to understand. <br>Eg: Good morning, addition, subtraction.</li>
        </details><br>
        <p>C is having both low level and high level features. Hence C is <mark>a middle level</mark>language.</p>
    </fieldset> <br><br><br>

    <fieldset>
        <legend>What is a translator?</legend>
            <p>Always the user given input [ program ] is in English, which is called source code / source program. 
                But the computer is not able to understand English. 
                Due to this we have to convert this source code to binary code and to check the errors [ programming mistakes ] 
                with the help of translator.</p>
        <details>
            <summary> 3 types of translators.</summary>
            <li class="ans">1.Compiler: Compiler and interpreter both used to convert high level languages to binary code. 
            <br>Compiler converts the total source code into binary code at once by leaving error lines.</li><br>
            <li class="ans">2.Interpreter: checks line by line.</li><br>
            <li class="ans">3.Assembler: working style is similar to the compiler.</li>
        </details>

        <legend>Errors</legend>
        <p>Programming mistakes are called errors and they are of two types.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Type of Errors</summary>
            <li class="ans">1. Compile time errors / syntactical errors</li><br>
            <li class="ans">2.Runtime errors</li>
        </details>

        <legend>What is programming paradigm?</legend>
        <p>Every programming language comes with certain rules and regulations with a structure, which is technically called programming paradigm. Before c language the programming languages are using monolithic programming paradigm. In this paradigm the entire program they are creating with single [mono] program. Due to this it is very difficult to identify the errors, takes more memory and due to this performance is low. We can’t use part of the program in monolithic program.</p>
        <p>to avoid this problem, they have introduced pop [ procedure oriented programming structure ]. In pop a big program is divided into several small sub programs / sub routines / procedures / functions / modules / structures.</p>
        <br><h3>POP Advantages:</h3>
        <li>1.Modularity: Dividing a big program into small pieces according to the project requirement</li>
        <li>2.Simplicity: easy to read and understand.</li>
        <li>3.Reusability: write once, use many times.</li>
        <li>4.Efficiency: performance is high.</li>

        <legend>Why C is a general purpose language?</legend>
        <p>Using C language we can develop the applications like</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Applications</summary>
            <p>1.Operating systems<br>
                Eg: windows, unix, linux, android, mac, ios,…<br><br>
                2.Translators<br>
                Eg: compiler, interpreter, assembler<br><br>

                Eg: audio / video / usb / printer drivers<br><br>
                4.Data base<br>
                Eg: oracle, My SQL, SQL Server, mongodb,…<br><br>
                5.Commercial applications<br>
                Eg: hotel / super market / college / atm / google pay,…..<br><br>
                6.Embedded applications<br>
                Eg: Embedded s/w , Embedded receiver<br><br>
                7.PC & Mobile games<br><br>
                8.Antivirus<br>
                Eg: quick heal, macfee, avast,…<br><br>
                9.Media players<br>
                Eg: vlc, mx-player, windows media player,..<br><br>
                10. Editors<br>
                Eg: ms-word, notepad, wordpad,…<br><br>
                11. Browsers<br>
                Eg: chrome, firefox,….<br><br>
                12. Any type of standalone applications.<br>
                Eg: ms-office, calendar, calculator<br><br>
                Hence c is also called it is a multipurpose programming language
